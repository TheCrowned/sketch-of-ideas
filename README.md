Consider two quantities `L` and `U`, with `L` being a characteristic scale-length of the phenomenon $

So if `L/U \geq 1/\Omega`, the phenomenon IS a *large-scale* one. Thus we can define `\epsilon = U/2$

(Notice that `\Omega` is in theory equal to `2\omega\sin(\phi)`, with \omega being the earth rotatio$
